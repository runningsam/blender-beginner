Now click here on Data

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_289_img_1.png](images/page_289_img_1.png)

You will see something new called Shape keys.

![page_289_img_2.png](images/page_289_img_2.png)

So what are Shape keys?

Shape keys are used to deform object geometry into new shapes for animation.

The most popular case is using shape keys for character facial animation, but you can use itfor other things, like in this case for making empty balloon inflated and vice versa.

First, click on that “+” sign to add a new Shape key.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_290_img_1.png](images/page_290_img_1.png)

The first Shape key is called Basis.

![page_290_img_2.png](images/page_290_img_2.png)

You can rename it however you want. I renamed it to Balloon_full

![page_290_img_3.png](images/page_290_img_3.png)

Click once more on the “+” sign to add another Shape key.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_291_img_1.png](images/page_291_img_1.png)

You can rename it however you want. I renamed it to Balloon_empty.

![page_291_img_2.png](images/page_291_img_2.png)

From now on whatever you are doing, make sure that the second shape key is selectedbecause the first Shape key is the base one and you shouldn’t change it.

Switch back to edit mode with “TAB.”

![page_291_img_3.png](images/page_291_img_3.png)

Change view to right orthographic view with numpad 3 or click red X on the screen.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_292_img_1.png](images/page_292_img_1.png)

Turn on the X-ray mode by clicking here or pressing “ALT+Z”.

![page_292_img_2.png](images/page_292_img_2.png)

Switch to selecting vertices with 1 and select this part

![page_292_img_3.png](images/page_292_img_3.png)

And scale it with “S” for around 2.13

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_293_img_1.png](images/page_293_img_1.png)

Select this part

![page_293_img_2.png](images/page_293_img_2.png)

Click RMB and choose Smooth vertices

![page_293_img_3.png](images/page_293_img_3.png)

You can see that the new toolbar appeared in the left bottom corner - Smooth Vertices.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_294_img_1.png](images/page_294_img_1.png)

When you click on it, new options appeared

![page_294_img_2.png](images/page_294_img_2.png)

We will change Smoothing from 0.5 to 1

![page_294_img_3.png](images/page_294_img_3.png)

And change repeat to around 55

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_295_img_1.png](images/page_295_img_1.png)

Scale it with “`S+Z`” for around 0.6

![page_295_img_2.png](images/page_295_img_2.png)

And move it with “`G+Z`” for around -0.55

![page_295_img_3.png](images/page_295_img_3.png)

Turn on the Proportional editing with “O” or by clicking here

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_296_img_1.png](images/page_296_img_1.png)

Turn off the X-ray mode with “ALT+Z”

![page_296_img_2.png](images/page_296_img_2.png)

Scale it with “`S+X`” for around 0.69

![page_296_img_3.png](images/page_296_img_3.png)

Beginners guide to Blender

and scroll the mouse wheel down so your area of influence (Proportional size) is somewherearound 0.39.

![page_297_img_1.png](images/page_297_img_1.png)

After that scale it more with “`S+X`”so your balloon will look more deflated.

![page_297_img_2.png](images/page_297_img_2.png)

To improve look of your deflated ballon more, you can select a random vertex and move itaround with a “G”.

![page_297_img_3.png](images/page_297_img_3.png)

Beginners guide to Blender

For example I selected this vertex and moved it a bit with proportional editing turned on.

![page_298_img_1.png](images/page_298_img_1.png)

I did the same with this vertex

![page_298_img_2.png](images/page_298_img_2.png)

and this

![page_298_img_3.png](images/page_298_img_3.png)

and this

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_299_img_1.png](images/page_299_img_1.png)

If you switch to object mode with “TAB”, your balloon will be full again. That is because valueof the second shape key is set to 0.

![page_299_img_2.png](images/page_299_img_2.png)

As you are moving the value towards 1, the balloon becomes more and more deflated.

![page_299_img_3.png](images/page_299_img_3.png)

And if you are moving the value towards 0, the balloon become more full again. We will leaveit at 0 so it stays full for now.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_300_img_1.png](images/page_300_img_1.png)

It is time for texturing it. Click on Material properties

![page_300_img_2.png](images/page_300_img_2.png)

Click on New to add a new material

![page_300_img_3.png](images/page_300_img_3.png)

Rename the material to Balloon_red or anything else you want.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_301_img_1.png](images/page_301_img_1.png)

Switch to Material Preview mode by clicking here

![page_301_img_2.png](images/page_301_img_2.png)

Place the cursor on the upper side of the screen as shown, and when you see plus,

![page_301_img_3.png](images/page_301_img_3.png)

just pull it down to the left while holding the left mouse click.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_302_img_1.png](images/page_302_img_1.png)

Switch from 3D viewport to Shader editor.

![page_302_img_2.png](images/page_302_img_2.png)

Change the Base color to any color you want. I chose red.

![page_302_img_3.png](images/page_302_img_3.png)

Change Alpha to 0.5

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_303_img_1.png](images/page_303_img_1.png)

Change Roughness to 0.3

![page_303_img_2.png](images/page_303_img_2.png)

Position the mouse to the Base color that you choose and copy it with “CTRL+C”

![page_303_img_3.png](images/page_303_img_3.png)

Duplicate the whole Principled BSDF with “SHIFT+D” and move it down a bit

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_304_img_1.png](images/page_304_img_1.png)

Go to *`Add → Shader → Mix`* Shader

![page_304_img_2.png](images/page_304_img_2.png)

And put it between the first Principled BSDF and Material Output.

![page_304_img_3.png](images/page_304_img_3.png)

Connect BSDF from second Principled BSDF with Shader from Mix Shader.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_305_img_1.png](images/page_305_img_1.png)

Change Roughness in the second Principled BSDF to around 0.7

![page_305_img_2.png](images/page_305_img_2.png)

And Alpha to 1

![page_305_img_3.png](images/page_305_img_3.png)

If you change factor in Mix Shader to 0 your balloon will look like this

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_306_img_1.png](images/page_306_img_1.png)

and the more you increase it towards 1, it will look like this

![page_306_img_2.png](images/page_306_img_2.png)

Go to Data and make sure that the Second Shape key called Balloon_empty is selected

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_307_img_1.png](images/page_307_img_1.png)

Go to this Value

![page_307_img_2.png](images/page_307_img_2.png)

And now it is time to use something called Drivers.

And what are Drivers?

Drivers are a way to control values of properties by means of a function, or a mathematicalexpression.

Let me show you in a real example.

Press RMB and choose Copy as a new Driver.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_308_img_1.png](images/page_308_img_1.png)

Now select Mix Shader

![page_308_img_2.png](images/page_308_img_2.png)

Click RMB on Fac and choose Paste Driver.

Beginners guide to Blender

![page_309_img_1.png](images/page_309_img_1.png)

You Mix Shader Fac now looks like this

![page_309_img_2.png](images/page_309_img_2.png)

Now when you move the value of a Second Shape Key, your balloon gets inflated,rougnessalso changes and vice versa.
