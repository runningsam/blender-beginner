​Ok, that is really it now!​
​Thank you for reading and learning with me!​
​Happy Blending!​
​Bye, see you next time :D​
​Chapter 25 - Modeling, texturing and​​animating a magic potion​​(Blender Version 4.2.1)​
​This time you will learn how to model, texture and animate a magic potion.​
​(You can check out video tutorial on my YouTube channel:​​https://youtu.be/msj0kz-dOP8​​)​
​Let’s begin!​
​Select all with “A” and delete with “X.”​

​To hide (disable) the object in the render, click on this camera icon.​
​79​
​Beginners guide to Blender​

![page_80_img_1.png](../images/page_80_img_1.png)

​The second sphere is now hidden in the viewport and in the render.​

​To fix this part, add more segments and amount.​

![page_89_img_2.png](../images/page_89_img_2.png)

​I added 4 segments and amount 0.035 but you can add as much as you want (just be careful​​to not add too much if you need low poly model - a model with less polygons).​

![page_89_img_3.png](../images/page_89_img_3.png)

​Now switch to the Rendered mode so you can add lights and materials and see how  magic​​potion looks with proper lighting.​
​89​
​Beginners guide to Blender​
​Now go to render properties, and switch from Render engine Eevee to Cycles.​
​Also if you have a good graphics card, you can switch from CPU to GPU.​
​Turn on the viewport denoise to get rid of the noise and make things easier for the eyes.​

![page_90_img_1.png](../images/page_90_img_1.png)

​Place the cursor on the upper side of the screen as shown, and when you see plus,​

![page_90_img_2.png](../images/page_90_img_2.png)

​91​
​Beginners guide to Blender​
​Connect Color from the Background with a Color from Sky Texture.​

![page_92_img_1.png](../images/page_92_img_1.png)

​As you can see, now you have a sky texture for your background.​

![page_92_img_2.png](../images/page_92_img_2.png)

​You can switch from Nishita to Hosek/Wilike for a bit different type of sky shader if you want.​
​92​
​Beginners guide to Blender​

![page_93_img_1.png](../images/page_93_img_1.png)

​Go to Add → Converter → Color Ramp and add it between Sky Texture and Background.​

![page_93_img_2.png](../images/page_93_img_2.png)

​Change Background Strength to 3 or similar if you want your world to become brighter.​

![page_93_img_3.png](../images/page_93_img_3.png)

​Select the first color picker of the Color Ramp and change it to darker blue (or any other color​​you want).​
​93​
​Beginners guide to Blender​

![page_94_img_1.png](../images/page_94_img_1.png)

​And move it a bit to the right.​

![page_94_img_2.png](../images/page_94_img_2.png)

​Switch from world to object.​

![page_94_img_3.png](../images/page_94_img_3.png)

​Go to material and add a new material.​
​94​
​Beginners guide to Blender​

![page_95_img_1.png](../images/page_95_img_1.png)

​Rename the Sphere.001 to Bottle (or anything else that you like.)​
​Rename the material to Glass (or anything else).​

![page_95_img_2.png](../images/page_95_img_2.png)

​Click on Transmission and put Weight to 1.​
​95​
​Beginners guide to Blender​

![page_96_img_1.png](../images/page_96_img_1.png)

​Put Roughness to 0.​

![page_96_img_2.png](../images/page_96_img_2.png)

​Unhide the first Sphere from the viewport and render.​

![page_96_img_3.png](../images/page_96_img_3.png)

​Select the Sphere and scale it just a little bit with an “S” to make it smaller than the bottle.​
​96​
​Beginners guide to Blender​

![page_97_img_1.png](../images/page_97_img_1.png)

​Rename it to the Potion (or anything else that you want).​
​Add a new material and rename it to the Liquid (or something else).​

​Click on Transmission and put Weight to 1.​
​97​
​Beginners guide to Blender​

![page_98_img_1.png](../images/page_98_img_1.png)

​Click on Emission and change color to Green (or something else).​

![page_98_img_2.png](../images/page_98_img_2.png)

​Because you didn’t add strength to the emission, you can’t see green color yet. Change​​strength from 0 to any number you want. I changed it to 0.7.​

![page_98_img_3.png](../images/page_98_img_3.png)

​98​
​Beginners guide to Blender​
​Switch to the world shader.​

![page_99_img_1.png](../images/page_99_img_1.png)

![page_100_img_2.png](../images/page_100_img_2.png)

​Connect Fac from the Mix Shader node with an Is Camera Ray from the Light Path Shader​​so that you change the sky to a flat color without affecting the lighting.​

​Beginners guide to Blender​

![page_109_img_1.png](../images/page_109_img_1.png)

​And to change the color of lighting, just change color of the first color picker in the color​​ramp.​

![page_109_img_2.png](../images/page_109_img_2.png)

​And to change the gradient of the second sky color just change the second color picker in the​​color ramp. That way you can have multicolored highlights on your glass.​
